                My name is Kevin and I was born in Wilson North Carolina and have lived in North Carolina my entire life.  I originally went to school to for Electronic Engineering but after
                getting my Associates degree I decided to go to school for automotive.  After I graduated with my degree in automotive I got a job working at Audi in Raleigh North Carolina
                and moved to Raleigh. While I was living in Raleigh I married my beautiful wife Alicia and we have been married now for almost six years and we have 2 beautiful children.  After 
                living in Raleigh for only a year we decided to move to the Charlotte area in March of 2013 where I began working for Audi of Charlotte.
